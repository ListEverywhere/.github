<h1>ListEverywhere</h1>
<p>ListEverywhere is a digital shopping list and recipe sharing application that allows for users to access their lists from anywhere with an internet connection. Users can easily create, modify, and delete shopping lists within the application, replacing the dated paper list or note-taking application. After registering for a free account, users can begin creating their shopping lists that are readily available at the store or at home. While shopping in the store, users can quickly check off items as they go through the aisles.<br><br>
ListEverywhere provides a unique feature to enhance the shopping experience of users: recipe integration within lists. Users can find recipes that include ingredients from their list and integrate it into their list. Users will always know what to purchase as ingredients from their list and the recipe automatically merge. This simplifies the process of creating a meal plan, as this application can prepare the list at home or at the store. If users are unable to find a specific recipe, they can create their own recipes inside of the application. Additionally, they can publish this recipe so that other users can incorporate it into their own shopping lists.
